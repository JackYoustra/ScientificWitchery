# SPM background

Swift Package Manager (SPM) is the current standard package manager for Swift projects,
and the default way of adding dependencies to your project. It's great, but it has a few
quirks that can be a bit annoying. An example SPM file looks like the following:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.6
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v14),
        .macOS(.v11),
        .tvOS(.v14),
        .watchOS(.v7)
    ],
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "MyPackage",
            targets: ["MyPackage"]
        ),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/JackYoustra/MTTransitions", from: "1.0.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyPackage",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "MTTransitions", package: "MTTransitions"),
            ]
        ),
    ]
)
```

The `dependencies` section is where you add other packages to your project.
The `targets` section is where you add the dependencies to your targets.

The recursive nature of SPM's dependency resolution means that dependencies are transitively included.
For example, suppose `MTTransitions`'s `Package.swift` file looks like the following:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MTTransitions",
    platforms: [
        .iOS(.v14),
    ],
    products: [
        // Products define the executables and libraries a package produces, and make them visible to other packages.
        .library(
            name: "MTTransitions",
            targets: ["MTTransitions"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
       .package(
            name: "MetalPetal",
            url: "https://github.com/MetalPetal/MetalPetal",
            from: "1.24.2"
       )
    ],
    targets: [
        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package. A target can define a module or a test suite.
        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package, and on products in packages this package depends on.
        .target(
            name: "MTTransitions",
            dependencies: [
                "MetalPetal"
            ],
            path: "Source",
            resources: [
                .process("Assets.bundle")
            ]
        ),
    ]
)
```

Transitive dependency inclusion means that `MyPackage` implicitly depends on `MetalPetal` through `MTTransitions`.
This automatic transitive dependency resolution is really nice so you don't have to worry about including `MetalPetal` in your `Package.swift` file
in order for `MTTransitions` to build successfully.

# The problem

However, SPM is too restrictive to accomodate all use cases. Building this project right now will fail, because several of of `MTTransitions`'s source files depend on headers in `MetalPetal`.
For example, `MTBowTieVerticalTransition.metal` includes `MTIShaderLib.h`.

Trying to build this project will fail with the following error:

```bash

# The solution

My old solution revolved around patching the metal compiler to include the `MetalPetal` headers in the search path whenever invoked.
This was quite hacky, and the script was failure prone, and if it failed, you'd have to reinstall the metal compiler which usually involved reinstalling xcode.

## Passing in an include path to the compiler (the normal approach, doesn't work)

The first step is to look at the SPM documentation for [custom build commands](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/target).
The documentation states that you can add unsafe compiler flags to the build command, which is exactly what we need. Unfortunately, the only arguments available
are `cSettings, cxxSettings, swiftSettings, and linkerSettings`. None of these are applicable to the metal compiler.
If this were a C++, C, or Swift file, we could write a `.unsafeFlags(["-I", "path/to/headers"])` to the `MTTransitions` target's `metalSettings` and be done with it.

## Running the compiler in a modified global include environment (the alternative approach, doesn't work)

The next step is to look at the metal compiler documentation by running `man metal` in the terminal.
The documentation states that you can pass `-I` to the compiler to add a search path for headers, but, as we've seen, we can't pass in command-line flags.

The documentation _also_ states that you can set environment variables. Some examples include CPATH and C_INCLUDE_PATH. Indeed, running the command straight from a terminal, this works!

```bash
CPATH=/Users/jack/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyPackage-randomuuid/SourcePackages/checkouts/MetalPetal/Sources/MetalPetalObjectiveC/include /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/metal -c -target air64-apple-ios14.0 -I/Users/jackyoustra/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyPackage-randomuuid/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/NanoFlick/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/include -F/Users/jackyoustra/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyPackage-randomuuid/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/NanoFlick/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos -isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS16.1.sdk -ffast-math -serialize-diagnostics /Users/jackyoustra/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyPackage-randomuuid/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/NanoFlick/IntermediateBuildFilesPath/MTTransitions.build/Release-iphoneos/MTTransitions_MTTransitions.build/Metal/MTBowTieVerticalTransition.dia -o /Users/jackyoustra/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyPackage-randomuuid/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/NanoFlick/IntermediateBuildFilesPath/MTTransitions.build/Release-iphoneos/MTTransitions_MTTransitions.build/Metal/MTBowTieVerticalTransition.air -MMD -MT dependencies -MF /Users/jackyoustra/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyPackage-randomuuid/Build/Intermediates.noindex/ArchiveIntermediates/NanoFlick/IntermediateBuildFilesPath/MTTransitions.build/Release-iphoneos/MTTransitions_MTTransitions.build/Metal/MTBowTieVerticalTransition.dat /Users/jackyoustra/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyPackage-randomuuid/SourcePackages/checkouts/MTTransitions/MTTransitions/Transitions/MTBowTieVerticalTransition.metal

```

The final step is to figure out how to set environment variables in a custom build command. The documentation states that you can use `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment` to get the environment variables, but it doesn't say how to set them. Even if we could set them, we'd be setting them at the wrong time - we'd have to set them at build time, not at package resolution time.
A few minutes of googling showed a hack to get xcode to run with [a custom environment variable](https://forums.swift.org/t/swiftpm-and-swappable-libraries/43593), but opening xcode with a custom console command  seemed error-prone, easy to forget, and difficult to use with whatever other build tools we end up using. Additionally, we might've been able to use a scheme, but at this point, I was disillusioned with the odds of gettting an environment variable to work.

## Patching xcode's build rules (works)

At this point, I decided to look again at the original command, and realized that the xcode compile commands probably define how to invoke the compiler, and default arguments passed.
Running `rg CompileMetalFile /Applications/Xcode.app/` showed that the compiler is invoked in a file called `MetalCompiler.xcspec` in the xcode app bundle.
A quick look at the file showed that it's a plist file specifying the different xcode build settings that can be changed in the `.pbxproj` file and how these build
settings translated to command-line arguments. For example
    
```xml
{
    Name = "MTL_FAST_MATH";
    Type = Bool;
    DefaultValue = YES;
    Category = BuildOptions;
    CommandLineArgs = {
        YES = (
            "-ffast-math",
        );
        NO = (
            "-fno-fast-math",
        );
    };
},
```

There was also our include path, which was defined as a build setting called `MTL_INCLUDE_PATHS`:

```xml
{
    Name = "MTL_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS";
    Type = PathList;
    "FlattenRecursiveSearchPathsInValue" = Yes;
    DefaultValue = "";
    CommandLinePrefixFlag = "-I";
    Category = BuildOptions;
},
```

To fix this, I wrote a python script that patches the `MetalCompiler.xcspec` file to add the `MetalPetal` headers to the search path.

```python
import subprocess as sp
import re
from pathlib import Path


# seeing as the above two didn't work, patch by modifying the .xcspec
def patch_via_compile_instruction(build_dir):
    # run xcode-select -p to get the path to the Xcode app
    response = sp.check_output(["xcode-select", "-p"]).decode("utf-8").strip()
    xcode_path = Path(response)
    # find the xcspec file
    instruction_path = xcode_path.parent / "PlugIns/XCBSpecifications.ideplugin/Contents/Resources/MetalCompiler.xcspec"

    # read the file
    with open(instruction_path, "r") as f:
        contents = f.read()
    # replace the line without a lookbehind
    contents = re.sub(r'("MTL_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS";\s*Type = PathList;\s*"FlattenRecursiveSearchPathsInValue" = Yes;\s*DefaultValue = )"";', r'\1' + str(metalpetal_include(build_dir)), contents, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    # write the file
    print("Writing changed to " + str(instruction_path))
    with open(instruction_path, "w") as f:
        f.write(contents)

def find_build_location():
    # This assumes you have an xcodeproj from which you host your package. You can probably find the cloned folder another way, too
    output = sp.check_output(["xcodebuild", "-project", "App/MyPackage.xcodeproj", "-showBuildSettings"]).decode("utf-8").strip()
    build_dir = re.search(r"^\s*BUILD_DIR = (.*)", output, re.MULTILINE).group(1)
    return build_dir

# Finds the include file in the MetalPetal include folder and copies (clones) it to the MetalFilter and MetalTransition build directories
def patch():
    build_dir = find_build_location()
    print(build_dir)
    patch_via_compile_instruction(build_dir)

patch()

```

This script can be run as a plugin, but I just manually run it whenever I see the build error appear. It's not ideal, but it works.
