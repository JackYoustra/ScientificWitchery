# TCA background

Traditionally, SwiftUI architectures are built on islands of state associated to views. This is a great way to get started, but it can be limiting as your app grows.
It's challenging to find a way to react to state changes in one view from another view, or to share state between views,
without resorting to a global state store or repeatedly passing bindings and publishers to each view.

The Composable Architecture (or TCA) is a library for building applications in a predictable and testable way. It is a port of the Elm architecture to Swift.
If you are interested in learning more about it, I recommend the video series by the creator, [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co).

## Elm architecture

The Elm architecture has three main concepts:
 - Model: A struct that represents the current state of the application.
 - View: A pure function that renders the UI, whose actions, such as button presses, can send messages to the update function.
 - Update: A pure function that takes the current state and an action and returns a new state. Can also return an asynchronous command to perform side effects - tasks that submit messages to the update function at a later time.

## TCA architecture

TCA implements the Elm architecture in a slightly different way as implied by its namesake: it divides functional components into different modules, so each module has its own state, actions, and reducers. This approach has several components over the monolithic approach:

-   It makes it easier to reason about the state of the application as each module has its own state.
-   It makes it easier to test each module in isolation.
-   It makes it easier to reuse modules in other applications (or in the same application in different places).
-   It improves compile times - unless directly depending on other modules, each module can be compiled in parallel.

# The problem

Suppose we have three views: Home(`A`), Profile(`B`), and Profile Detail(`C`), with each one having its own state and actions. The Profile Detail view is a child of the Profile view, and the Profile view is a child of the Home view.

They each refer to a `User` object, which should only be in one place. Any updates to the `User` object should reflect everywhere.
Logically, every state should at least have the potential to have its own state for modularity and testability - in order for it to be used in isolation, it has to carry (what at least looks like) its environment around with it. How can this be done?

```swift
// This should probably be a more expressive value type, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll use an int.
public typealias User = Int

public struct A {
    var a: User
    var b: B
}

struct B {
    var c: C
}

struct C {
    // Injected
    var a: User
    var r: String
}

public func test(_ arg: A) -> User {
    var a = arg
    a.b.c.a = 1
    return a.b.c.a
}

public func test2(_ arg: A) -> User {
    var a = arg
    a.a = 1
    return a.b.c.a
}
```

# The solution

## Memory sharing

The obvious option is to use a reference type to share the state that should be mirrored.

```swift
public typealias User = Int

class Rc<T> {
    var value: T
    init(_ value: T) {
        self.value = value
    }
}

public struct A {
    private(set) var a: Rc<User>
    var b: B

    init(a: Rc<User>, b: B) {
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
        self.b.c.a = a
    }

    // Problem: lose top-level copyability - User will be duplicated
    // If we could run this code on a clone, the copy semantics would be upheld
    mutating func copyInternal() {
        self.a = Rc(self.a.value)
        self.b.c.a = self.a
    }
}

struct B {
    var c: C
}

struct C {
    // Injected
    var a: Rc<User>
    var r: String
}

public func test(_ arg: A) -> User {
    var a = arg
    a.b.c.a = 1
    return a.b.c.a
}

public func test2(_ arg: A) -> User {
    var a = arg
    a.a = 1
    return a.b.c.a
}
```

Unfortunately, we can't override the copy constructor in swift, so we would lose copy semantics for our state objects. This is a problem because we want to be able to copy the state of our application at any time, and we want to be able to run tests on the copied state.

## Computed dependency injection

The 'better' way is just manual injection.
It's pretty verbose, but it preserves every correctness property we're concerned with.

```swift
public typealias User = Int

public struct A {
    struct Origin {
        var a: User
        var b: B.Origin
    }

    struct Environment {}

    var origin: Origin
    var environment: Environment
    
    var b: B {
        get {
            B(origin: origin.b, environment: B.Environment(c: C.Environment(a: origin.a)))
        }
        set {
            origin.b = newValue.origin
            origin.a = newValue.environment.c.a
        }
    }
}

struct B {
    // Holds non-dependent data
    struct Origin {
        var originC: C.Origin        
    }

    struct Environment {
        var c: C.Environment
    }

    var origin: Origin
    var environment: Environment

    var c: C {
        get {
            C(origin: origin.originC, environment: environment.c)
        }
        set {
            environment.c = newValue.environment
            origin.originC = newValue.origin
        }
    }
}

struct C {
    struct Origin {
        var r: String
    }

    struct Environment {
        var a: User
    }

    var origin: Origin
    var environment: Environment

    var a: User {
        get {
            environment.a
        }
        set {
            environment.a = newValue
        }
    }
}


public func test(_ arg: A) -> User {
    var a = arg
    a.b.c.a = 1
    return a.b.c.a
}

public func test2(_ arg: A) -> User {
    var a = arg
    a.a = 1
    return a.b.c.a
}
```

This is a lot better, but it's still not great. We have to manually inject the dependencies, and we have to manually update the dependencies. This is a lot of boilerplate code, and it's easy to make mistakes.
We can use the compiler to verify that the two test functions yield the same results, and, indeed, [Godbolt shows](https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/sb9TWMq5Y) `test` is aliased to `test2` in the injected solution (line 873 in the asm output).

Ideally, we'd use something like Rust's [proc_macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html), to generate these getters and setters, but unfortunately
Swift has no metaprogramming facilities at all. There's a very recent SE proposal for [proc_macros in swift](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-possible-vision-for-macros-in-swift/60900) but it's very early on and there's been a [shocking](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-possible-vision-for-macros-in-swift/60900/3) [amount](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-possible-vision-for-macros-in-swift/60900/7) [of](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-possible-vision-for-macros-in-swift/60900/22) [pushback](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-possible-vision-for-macros-in-swift/60900/74)
for a system that has been _already tested and loved by the Rust community, which Swift has, for years, taken its cues from!_
So, despite [exciting new demos](/blog/swift-macros-proposal), who knows about its future?

For now, there may lie a solution in the hack that is [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery), which is a code generator that can generate code from templates. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a start.
It's nontrivial to generate these, so for now I'll just be manually writing them until I can figure out a better solution.
