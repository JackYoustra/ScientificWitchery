As a developer and tools enthusiast, I've come across various things that have significantly improved my productivity and / or QoL. This list compiles some of the most useful ones I've encountered, along with brief descriptions and links. Whether you're a seasoned computer user or just starting out, you might find something here to enhance your own toolkit.

## File and Directory Management

- [ripgrep: Grep (a finder) but way better. Respects .gitignore, ignores binary files, and much more!](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
  - multithreaded
  - `rg -tpy foo` limits your search to Python files
  - `rg -z foo` _includes contents of compressed files_ in your search
  - Regex support
  - Unicode support (grep doesn't)
  - [Common options md](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#common-options) (symbolic links, sort, etc)
- [Dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust)
  - Quickly make a tree of filesizes in a directory
  - No interactive mode! For that, use [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) instead
- [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) - interactive du / dust
- [duf](https://github.com/muesli/duf) - A better df
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - A better cat (highlighting and git)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - A better find. Stop doing `find . | rg <name>`
- [exa](https://the.exa.website/) - A better ls.
- [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) - Command line csv query engine
- [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) - Quick command line benchmarking

- Jdupes:
  - Theory: if you have two files, A and B, and they're both the same, but you don't want to [hardlink](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:624/1*bEu7dBB67IXWxxb_Qi8A0w.jpeg) them because if you change one you don't want it to reflect on the other, you're usually in a tough spot. Some filesystems (notably APFS - the mac file system) support _cloning_, though, which means that the copy is instead _delayed_, it's treated as a hardlink until there's a write to the contents of either file, at which point the copy actually happens and there's a write to the second file as the new file
  - Jdupes does this in reverse: it scans a file structure, identifies duplicates, and replaces the duplicates with clones.
  - It can do this with hardlinks and softlinks on non-cloning filesystems, but I'd discourage it as it isn't a pure space optimization (can change behavior)
    - Test if your filesystem supports copy on write by running `cp â€“reflink=always <trivial> <trivial copy>`. If it fails, no support. If it succeeds, support.
  - Not good for reliable performance, but really shouldn't matter

## Git Tools

- [Gitkracken](https://www.gitkraken.com/): a nice git explorer + cool commit graph (ai commit messages now too). Free for students and most repos. Has a vscode extension [gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- Clone blobless by default and shallow if you really just need a one-shot: https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/

## GPU Monitoring

- [Nvidia-smi+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RSIP-Vision.nvidia-smi-plus): makes a nvidia smi window in xcode (also can do amd gpus)
- [Nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop): better nvidia-smi
- [Nvitop](https://github.com/XuehaiPan/nvitop): better nvidia-smi
  _Note, you can also look at [this article](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/keeping-an-eye-on-your-gpus-2) for an overview of the ecosystem_

## General dev tools

- [Quicktype](https://app.quicktype.io/): translate any json to parsing code + types, or just types. Supports most languages.
- [difftastic](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic) - structural diff tool
- [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold) - faster linker

## LLM tools

- [LLM visualizer](https://bbycroft.net/llm) The best LLM visualization tool. I use it to reason about how LLMs work, much easier than grokking math.
- [code2prompt: Code repository to prompt. A nice preamble to attach to code queries!](https://github.com/mufeedvh/code2prompt)
- [llm-explorer](https://llm-explorer.com/) - a tool for finding useful llms for whatever task you may have.
- [Interact with streams as if they were json](https://github.com/h4l/json.bash)
  - [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) allows you to query json on command line too
- [Outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines) - constrained LLM generation (simple)
- [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) - constrained LLM generation (complex)
  _(or, if you want to do it manually)_
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library) - really quickly and easily run models! Can run most open source models at most quantization levels (via llama.cpp)
  - Run the server: `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1 OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=0 OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=0 OLLAMA_DEBUG=1 OLLAMA_GRAMMAR=true ./ollama serve`
  - Pull: `ollama pull llama3:8b-instruct-q8_0`
  - Make requests
    - CLI: `ollama run` (can just chat in terminal)
    - OpenAI compatible API: just point the openai sdk to localhost:11434
      - Slightly different if not localhost, some [additional setup](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-use-ollama-with-ngrok) required
  - [Runpod has out of the box support for an ollama client](https://docs.runpod.io/tutorials/pods/run-ollama)
- Quicktype -> ollama (a fork thereof): [see my blog post](/blog/typescript-with-ollama#implementation) for a guide, but you can constrain LLM output to fit a typescript type (or any json schema). Useful for running experiments (for example, my implementation of TAP had _no error handling / retry code_ needed).
  - NB: for now, you're going to have to manually build ollama for this. It's not too tricky and you can use neat flags, but the grammar PR hasn't been merged yet, so either build a branch yourself or ask me for mine (be more than happy to do it).

## LLM performance tools

- [inside-the-matrix](https://pytorch.org/blog/inside-the-matrix/) - a tool to visualize a series of matmuls

## Python tools

- [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - convert notebooks to other formats. Useful if you have a notebook that you want to convert to a script for LLM iteration.
- [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - If you get tons of install issues with nbconvert (like me), this also works quite well.

## Swift tools
