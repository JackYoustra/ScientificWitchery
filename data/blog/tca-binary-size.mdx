summary: Porting an app to a uFeature architecture leads to a doubling in binary size. Why? How can we fix it?
---

# Introduction

So right now I'm putting the finishing touches on the TCA rewrite of NanoFlick, and it's looking pretty slick!
Unfortunately, it's literally double the size! The release executable of NanoFlick is ~80mb, while the release
executable of NanoFlickTCA is ~175mb!

This is way, way too much of an increase based on what's actually being expressed, so lets try and get it down.

# Diagnosis
The first port of call is a tool my friend showed me called [bloaty](https://github.com/google/bloaty). It's
a tool that can analyse the size of a binary and break it down into sections. Here's the output of NanoFlickTCA:

So, the first thing to notice is that the `__LINKEDIT` section is much larger in NanoFlickTCA.
One of the big things we did in TCA was rewrite to a [uFeatures](https://docs.tuist.io/building-at-scale/microfeatures/) architecture to save on compile times.
A consequence is we have a lot more modules, and therefore a lot more linking to do.
The `__LINKEDIT` section is where the linker puts all of the symbols that it needs to link to, so it makes sense that it's larger.
I tried [my normal trick](https://forums.swift.org/t/no-resilience-just-go-fast-compiler-flag/34758?page=2) of adding `-cross-module-optimization` and `-Xllvm -sil-cross-module-serialize-all`, but
it didn't seem to make much of a difference.

A quick ask to Bing Chat led me to consider that dead code stripping might be the culprit.
[Some](https://forums.swift.org/t/dead-code-stripping-on-a-dynamic-framework-doesnt-strip-unused-symbols-from-a-linked-static-library-spm/63690)
[people](https://forums.swift.org/t/why-public-symbols-are-always-no-dead-strip/47264/7) on the Swift forums
have noticed a similar issue, with the recommended solution being to add `-Xfrontend -internalize-at-link` to the linker flags.[^1]

And that helped nothing! Three megabytes off of the total size shaved off! What gives?
Cutter was unhelpful at looking at the `__LINKEDIT`, and checking `nm` showed that there were 50% more symbols in NanoFlickTCA than NanoFlick.
Perhaps that's a culprit? Looking at a diff of the outputs on `nm`, it seems that NanoFlickTCA has a lot more symbols with third-party libraries.
Apparently those never get stripped! How can I fix that?

Looking at a [blog post from emergetools](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/how-xcode14-unintentionally-increases-app-size), it
seems like a change introduced in xcode 14 affected apps with uFeatures architectures.
<sub>I'm a little jealous of their cool size graph, expect to see that a different date on this blog.</sub>
That sounds like our app! It seems like we can address this problem [by stripping binary symbols](https://docs.emergetools.com/docs/strip-binary-symbols).
And that fixed it! We're now sitting pretty at 54.5 mb. That's a 120mb reduction, or 68% of the original size!

Amazing! We're going to want to modify the strip command (we'd really like debug symbols if possible), but this is a great start!

Anyway, this *still* doesn't work because we get an error now when launching! "Bad Executable", it says.
Just checking that it still runs without the strip command, and it does. So what's going on?

Well, it turns out that the strip command is stripping out the `__LLVM_COV` section, which is used for code coverage.
I suspect that's causing the issue. Changing the strip command from
`strip -rSTx`
to
`strip -rx`
seemed to only leave 5MB on the table while preserving the `__LLVM_COV` section, and leading the app to launch.
Unfortunately, our debug symbols are gone!
`warning: (arm64) /Users/jack/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/NanoFlickTCA-eubkyvwpfwodfccpjvlfzmaqklts/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/NanoFlickTCA.app/NanoFlickTCA empty dSYM file detected, dSYM was created with an executable with no debug info.`

I really really want debug symbols and breakpoint support, so I wonder if there's a way to remove the local symbols without destroying everything else.


# A better way
I got pointed to using... an xcode build flag! [Deployment Postprocessing](https://dennisbabkin.com/blog/?t=macos-programming-xcode-build-schemes-diagnose-memory-corruption-and-crashes#dbg_w_crash_log),
so I decided to try that out. I'm a little nervous because it's off by default, but I can't see anyone saying anything
bad about it, so I'm going to try it out.

Op, that was literally exactly what we wanted. 54mb binary, debug symbols, slim `__LINKEDIT` and `__LLVM_COV` sections. Here's the output of bloaty:[^2]

[^2]: I'm not soooo sure about these precise numbers and attributions, but the broad point is that it's a lot smaller.

Actual xcbuild setting from god right there. I'm really curious what it changed.
Looking at the build logs before and after, the only difference appears to be a
`Strip NanoFlickTCA` step. We can either look through the xcspec files or just look in the inspector to find out what it does (I want to do both).
 - In our log, it does just
```
/Applications/Xcode-15.0.1.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/strip -D /Users/jack/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/NanoFlickTCA-eubkyvwpfwodfccpjvlfzmaqklts/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/NanoFlickTCA.app/NanoFlickTCA
```
 - It seems to refer to the `StripSymbols` XCSpec! We could've done the strip command inside xcode the whole time.
I'm a little worried about our debug symbols, but firebase should be able to symbolicate with our full dSYM file.

Anyway, this is a great result! I'm really happy with this.
I'd have liked this to be the default, but hopefully this blog post will help people who are in a similar situation.

[^1]: They also mentioned using `-Xfrontend -disable-reflection-metadata`, but that has [implications for SwiftUI](https://twitter.com/pointum/status/1347833028006047744) (at least since I last checked),
so I'm not going to try that. I do wonder, though, if you could opt-in to reflection metadata for TCA only and then, by only observe stores, avoid
SwiftUI's reliance on reflection metadata. Perhaps a post for a different day?
